I've created a comprehensive LifeBook application that transforms daily reflections into structured life stories. The platform combines beautiful design with powerful AI features to create a truly engaging journaling experience.

The application includes a complete database schema with Supabase migrations for entries and summaries, full API implementation for CRUD operations, advanced search functionality with "This day in history" memories, real-time auto-save functionality in the journal editor, comprehensive analytics with AI-generated summaries, and PDF export capabilities for creating beautiful life story books.

The design features premium aesthetics with smooth animations, a warm color palette perfect for journaling, responsive layouts optimized for all devices, and intuitive navigation with contextual features. The AI integration provides sentiment analysis for every entry, monthly/yearly summaries using OpenAI GPT-4, intelligent reflection prompts, and emotional insights tracking.

To complete the setup, you'll need to connect to Supabase using the "Connect to Supabase" button and add your OpenAI API key to the environment variables. The development server is now running and ready for your journaling journey!
